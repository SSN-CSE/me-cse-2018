** Course Objectives
- To learn advanced tree and graph structures.
- To learn the need for heap and disjoint set representations.
- To understand algorithm design techniques and apply suitable
  techniques for problems.

** Suggested Programming Languages
- C, Java or Python

** Suggestive Exercises
1. Insertion sort and merge sort with complexity analysis
2. Application of binary search trees 
3. Red-Black Trees
4. Min heaps, Fibonacci heaps 
5. Disjoint sets
6. Application of graph traversals -- BFS and DFS 
7. Single source Shortest Path Algorithms (e.g. Dijkstra's and Bellman
   Ford algorithms)  
8. All-pairs Shortest Path Algorithms: (e.g. Floyd's algorithm)
9. Dynamic programming (e.g. Longest common subsequence, 0/1 Knapsack)
10. Recursive backtracking (e.g. N-Queenâ€™s problem)
11. Greedy technique (e.g. Job/event scheduling, Minimum spanning tree)
12. Mini project: For a given application, identify and solve using
    suitable data structures and design techniques
