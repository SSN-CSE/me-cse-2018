** Course Objectives
    - To provide a foundation on topics in applied probability and
      statistical methods needed for modern optimization methods and
      risk modeling.
    - To address the issues and the principles of estimation theory,
      testing of hypothesis and multivariate analysis.

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to
 demonstrate competency in:
- Basic probability axioms and rules and the moments of discrete and
  continuous random variables (K3).
- Consistency, efficiency and unbiasedness of estimators, method of
  maximum likelihood estimation and Central Limit Theorem (K3).
- Use statistical tests in testing hypotheses on data (K3).
- Perform exploratory analysis of multivariate data, such as
  multivariate normal density, calculating descriptive statistics,
  testing for multivariate normality (K3).
- Use of the appropriate and relevant, fundamental and applied
  mathematical and statistical knowledge, methodologies and modern
  computational tools (K3).
