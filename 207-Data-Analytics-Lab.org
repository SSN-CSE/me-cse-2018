** Course Objectives
- To implement Map-Reduce programs for processing big data.
- To realize storage of big data using Hbase, MongoDB.
- To analyse big data using linear models.
- To analyse big data using machine learning techniques for
  classification and clustering.

** Suggestive Experiments
*** Hadoop 
1. Applications using Map-Reduce programming (Examples: word count /
   frequency programs / matrix multiplication)
2. Implement an MR program that processes a dataset.

*** R
3. Linear and logistic Regression (Loan prediction using Credit
   approval dataset, Sales prediction using Bigmart dataset)
4. SVM / Decision tree classification techniques (Flower type
   classification based on available attributes using Iris dataset,
   Passengers survival classification using titanic dataset)
5. Multilayer perceptron (Hand written digit classification using
   neural network)
6. Clustering (Document categorization by multiclass techniques)
7. Visualize data using any plotting framework

*** Database
8. Application that stores data in Hbase / MongoDB (Sentiment analysis
   using twitter dataset)
